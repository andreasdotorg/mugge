## Tier 0 — Core Software Installation

CamillaDSP, Mixxx, and Reaper are not yet installed on the Pi 4B (verified
2026-03-08). This tier covers installing the core software stack that all
other stories depend on.

## US-000: Core Audio Software Installation

**As** the system builder,
**I want** CamillaDSP, Mixxx, Reaper, and all required Python DSP libraries
installed on the Pi 4B with verified basic functionality,
**so that** subsequent stories (benchmarks, latency tests, stability tests,
room correction pipeline) have a working software foundation.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** none (first story to execute)
**Blocks:** US-001 (CamillaDSP must be installed for CPU benchmarks), US-002 (CamillaDSP must be installed for latency measurement), US-006 (Mixxx must be installed for feasibility testing), US-017 (Reaper must be installed for IEM routing)
**Decisions:** none yet

**Note:** As of 2026-03-08, the Pi has PipeWire running (pipewire, pipewire-pulse,
wireplumber) and a labwc Wayland desktop. CamillaDSP, Mixxx, Reaper, and
RustDesk are not installed.

ADAT -> USB -> PipeWire),
**so that** I can confirm the live mode latency stays below the singer's
slapback perception threshold.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** US-000 (CamillaDSP must be installed; can run in parallel with US-001)

configurations, monitoring for xruns, CPU usage, and thermal throttling,
**so that** I can confirm the system is reliable enough for a full live
performance without audio dropouts or thermal shutdown.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** US-001 (need to know which filter length/chunksize config to test)
**Blocks:** US-007 through US-011 (pipeline work should not proceed if platform is unstable)
**Decisions:** D-002 (dual chunksize), D-003 (16,384-tap FIR)

project relies on, tracked in a structured format,
**so that** hidden risks are surfaced early and can be validated before they
cause problems during implementation or live performance.

## US-005: Hercules DJControl Mix Ultra USB-MIDI Functional Verification

**As** the DJ,
**I want** to verify that the Hercules DJControl Mix Ultra works as a
functional USB-MIDI controller on the Pi 4B (beyond just USB enumeration),
**so that** I can use it to control Mixxx during DJ/PA sets.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** none (USB enumeration already confirmed by owner)
**Blocks:** US-006 (Mixxx feasibility includes controller integration)
**Decisions:** none yet

**Note:** Owner has already confirmed USB enumeration via `lsusb`. This story
covers functional MIDI verification: does it send/receive MIDI messages?

**Acceptance criteria:**

- [ ] MIDI messages verified: pressing buttons/moving faders produces MIDI events visible in `aseqdump` or `amidi`
- [ ] All control types tested: faders, knobs, buttons, jog wheels (if applicable)
- [ ] Any non-functional controls documented
- [ ] If USB-MIDI does not work: document the failure mode and research alternatives (Bluetooth MIDI via bluez, community firmware, etc.)

**DoD:**
- [ ] Test completed on Pi 4B hardware

## US-006: Mixxx on Pi 4B Feasibility

**As** the DJ,
**I want** to verify that Mixxx runs adequately on the Pi 4B with acceptable
UI responsiveness and audio performance,
**so that** I can use it as my DJ software for PA/DJ sets.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** US-000 (Mixxx must be installed), US-005 (need working MIDI controller to test DJ workflow)
**Blocks:** US-003/T3a (stability test with Mixxx requires Mixxx to be working)
**Decisions:** none yet

**Note:** The Pi runs labwc (Wayland compositor) with lightdm. Mixxx may need
X11/XWayland — verify. Remote access is via RustDesk (not VNC).

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Mixxx launches on Pi 4B (verify Wayland/XWayland compatibility with labwc)
- [ ] GPU configuration determined: document which `gpu_mem` value is needed (16 vs 128)

- [ ] If Mixxx is not viable: document the failure and evaluate alternatives

**DoD:**
- [ ] Tests completed on Pi 4B hardware
- [ ] Lab note with performance observations, configuration choices, screenshots/logs
- [ ] CLAUDE.md assumption A7 updated with validation result

## US-007: APCmini mk2 Mixxx Mapping Research and Creation

**As** the DJ,
**I want** a working Mixxx MIDI mapping for the Akai APCmini mk2,
**so that** I can use it as a supplementary controller (grid launcher, mixer,
effects) alongside the Hercules.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** US-006 (Mixxx must be working first)
**Blocks:** none (nice-to-have for DJ mode, not critical path)
**Decisions:** none yet

**Note:** The mk2 has a different MIDI mapping from the mk1. Existing mk1
mappings will not work without modification.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Research completed: Mixxx forums, GitHub, wiki checked for existing mk2 mappings
- [ ] If mapping exists: installed and tested on Pi 4B with Mixxx
- [ ] If no mapping exists: basic custom mapping created using Mixxx's MIDI learning wizard covering at minimum: play/cue, volume faders, crossfader, EQ kills
- [ ] APCmini mk2 LED feedback verified (button LEDs respond to Mixxx state)
- [ ] Mapping file committed to the project repository

**DoD:**
- [ ] Working mapping tested on Pi 4B hardware
- [ ] Lab note documenting the mapping layout and any limitations
- [ ] CLAUDE.md assumption A8 updated with validation result

described in CLAUDE.md "Next Steps." These depend on Tier 1 passing (confirming
the Pi 4B can handle FIR convolution at the chosen tap count).

---

## US-008: Measurement Engine — Sweep Generation, Recording, and Deconvolution

**As** the sound engineer,
**I want** a Python-based measurement engine that generates a log sweep, plays
it through a specified output channel, records the response via the UMIK-1,
and computes the impulse response via deconvolution,
**so that** I can measure the acoustic response of each speaker in the venue.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** US-001 (confirms viable filter length), US-002 (confirms latency path works)
**Blocks:** US-009 (time alignment needs impulse responses), US-010 (correction needs impulse responses), US-012 (end-to-end script wraps this)
**Decisions:** D-001 (minimum-phase FIR), D-004 (independent sub correction)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Log sweep generation: 20Hz-20kHz, configurable duration (default 5s), 48kHz sample rate
- [ ] UMIK-1 calibration file parsing: reads frequency/dB pairs from `/home/ela/7161942.txt`, applies magnitude correction to recorded response
- [ ] Per-channel measurement: plays sweep through one output channel at a time (channels 1-4), records on UMIK-1 input
- [ ] Deconvolution: computes impulse response from recorded sweep using inverse filter method
- [ ] Multiple measurement positions: supports taking 3-5 measurements at different mic positions, stores each separately
- [ ] Spatial averaging: averages multiple impulse responses (complex average in frequency domain) to reduce position sensitivity
- [ ] Output: per-channel averaged impulse response saved as WAV file
- [ ] Audio routing: correctly routes sweep output and UMIK-1 input through PipeWire/JACK
- [ ] Error handling: detects clipping, low signal level, or failed recording and reports clearly

**DoD:**
- [ ] Python module written with clear API
- [ ] Syntax-validated (`python -m py_compile`)
- [ ] Unit tests for sweep generation and deconvolution (synthetic test cases)
- [ ] Integration test on Pi 4B with actual UMIK-1 and USBStreamer
- [ ] Lab note with example impulse response plots

## US-009: Time Alignment Computation

**As** the sound engineer,
**I want** the system to automatically detect the arrival time of each
speaker's impulse response and compute the relative delays needed for time
alignment,
**so that** all speakers are phase-coherent at the listening position without
manual measurement.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** US-008 (needs per-channel impulse responses)
**Blocks:** US-012 (end-to-end script includes time alignment)
**Decisions:** D-004 (independent sub correction — each sub has its own delay)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Arrival time detection: finds the onset of energy in each channel's impulse response (threshold-based or envelope-based method)
- [ ] Relative delay computation: furthest speaker = reference (delay 0), all others get positive delay to compensate
- [ ] Delay values output in both samples and milliseconds at 48kHz
- [ ] Delay values formatted for CamillaDSP config (pipeline delay parameter)
- [ ] Edge cases handled: no arrival detected (speaker not connected), multiple peaks (strong early reflection), very short distances (all speakers equidistant)
- [ ] Results logged with clear per-channel breakdown

**DoD:**
- [ ] Python module written with clear API
- [ ] Syntax-validated (`python -m py_compile`)
- [ ] Unit tests with synthetic impulse responses at known delays
- [ ] Lab note with example delay computation from real measurements

## US-010: Correction Filter Generation

**As** the sound engineer,
**I want** the system to compute a room correction filter for each output
channel from its measured impulse response, applying psychoacoustic smoothing,
frequency-dependent windowing, regularization, and a user-selectable target
curve,
**so that** the correction addresses real room problems without chasing
artifacts or wasting amplifier headroom on uncorrectable nulls.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** US-008 (needs measured impulse responses)
**Blocks:** US-011 (crossover integration convolves correction with crossover shape), US-012 (end-to-end script wraps this)
**Decisions:** D-001 (minimum-phase FIR), D-003 (16,384-tap FIR)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Target curve support: at minimum Harman-like curve with SPL-dependent bass shelf. User can select from presets or provide custom curve file
- [ ] Frequency-dependent windowing: aggressive correction below ~300Hz (room modes), gentle correction above 300Hz (only broad speaker response deviations, not individual reflections/comb filtering)
- [ ] Psychoacoustic smoothing applied to measured response before inversion: 1/6 octave below 200Hz, 1/3 octave 200Hz-1kHz, 1/2 octave above 1kHz
- [ ] Regularization: maximum boost limited (configurable, default +12dB). Nulls are gently filled, not aggressively boosted
- [ ] Minimum-phase chain preserved throughout: measured IR minimum-phase extraction, inverse computation in minimum-phase domain
- [ ] Output: per-channel correction filter as minimum-phase FIR (not yet combined with crossover — that is US-011)
- [ ] Configurable filter length (default 16,384 taps, fallback 8,192)

**DoD:**
- [ ] Python module written with clear API
- [ ] Syntax-validated (`python -m py_compile`)
- [ ] Unit tests: synthetic room response with known mode -> verify correction flattens it
- [ ] Unit tests: verify output filter is minimum-phase (check via Hilbert transform)
- [ ] Lab note with example correction curves (before/after magnitude plots)

---

## US-011: Crossover Integration and Combined Filter Export

**As** the sound engineer,
**I want** the system to generate minimum-phase FIR crossover shapes (highpass
for mains, lowpass for subs), convolve them with the room correction filters,
and export the combined result as WAV files for CamillaDSP,
**so that** each output channel has a single FIR filter that handles both
crossover and room correction with minimum latency and no pre-ringing.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** US-010 (needs per-channel correction filters)
**Blocks:** US-012 (end-to-end script wraps this), US-013 (T5 verification needs real combined filters)
**Decisions:** D-001 (combined minimum-phase FIR), D-003 (16,384-tap FIR)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Crossover shape generation: highpass and lowpass as minimum-phase FIR, configurable crossover frequency (default 80Hz), configurable slope (48-96 dB/oct)
- [ ] Convolution of crossover shape with correction filter (multiply in frequency domain)
- [ ] Final combined filter converted to minimum-phase via Hilbert transform of log magnitude
- [ ] Truncation/windowing to target length (16,384 or 8,192 taps)
- [ ] Export as WAV files to CamillaDSP coefficients directory:
  - `combined_left_hp.wav` — Left main (highpass + correction)
  - `combined_right_hp.wav` — Right main (highpass + correction)
  - `combined_sub1_lp.wav` — Sub 1 (lowpass + correction)
  - `combined_sub2_lp.wav` — Sub 2 (lowpass + correction)
- [ ] WAV format: 48kHz, mono, float32
- [ ] Verification: combined filter magnitude response plotted, showing both crossover slope and correction effect

**DoD:**
- [ ] Python module written with clear API
- [ ] Syntax-validated (`python -m py_compile`)
- [ ] Unit tests: synthetic correction + crossover -> verify combined response shape
- [ ] Unit tests: verify output is minimum-phase
- [ ] Unit tests: verify WAV file format and length
- [ ] Lab note with example combined filter plots

## US-012: End-to-End Room Correction Automation Script

**As** the sound engineer setting up at a venue,
**I want** a single script that guides me through mic placement, runs all
measurements, computes correction filters, deploys them to CamillaDSP, updates
delay values, and optionally runs a verification measurement,
**so that** I can calibrate the system at each venue with one command and
minimal manual intervention.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** US-008 (measurement engine), US-009 (time alignment), US-010 (correction filters), US-011 (crossover integration)
**Blocks:** none
**Decisions:** D-001, D-002, D-003, D-004

**Acceptance criteria:**

## US-013: Correction Effectiveness Verification (Test T5)

**As** the sound engineer,
**I want** to verify that the generated 16,384-tap FIR correction filters
actually provide effective room correction down to 20Hz,
**so that** I can confirm the filter design achieves its stated goals and the
sub-bass correction works as designed.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** US-011 (needs real combined filters generated from real measurements)
**Blocks:** none
**Decisions:** D-003 (16,384-tap FIR)

**Acceptance criteria:**

**so that** I can understand WHY the system is designed this way, not just HOW
it is configured.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** US-014 (documentation structure must exist)
**Blocks:** none
**Decisions:** D-001, D-002, D-003, D-004

## US-016: How-To Guides

**As** a user of the audio workstation,
**I want** task-oriented how-to guides for common operations (initial setup,
switching modes, running calibration, connecting controllers, headless
operation),
**so that** I can perform each task without reading the entire setup manual.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** US-014 (documentation structure must exist), US-012 (calibration how-to depends on the automation script existing)
**Blocks:** none
**Decisions:** none

**Note:** The how-to for room calibration (US-012's DoD includes a how-to)
should live in this collection. Other how-tos can be written as the
corresponding features are implemented.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] At minimum these guides written:

## Tier 5 — Singer IEM and Live Mode

Stories specific to live vocal performance mode.

---

## US-017: Singer IEM Mix — Engineer-Controlled Independent Mix

**As** the live sound engineer,
**I want** to control the singer's in-ear monitor mix independently of the main
PA mix and the engineer headphone mix,
**so that** the singer hears an optimal monitor blend (her voice, backing tracks,
vocal cues) without affecting what the audience hears.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** US-003 (live mode stability confirmed)
**Blocks:** US-018 (singer self-control is a future enhancement of this)
**Decisions:** D-002 (live mode chunksize 512)

**Note:** MVP scope per owner direction: engineer controls the IEM mix. Singer
self-control of her own mix is a nice-to-have (see US-018). IEM signal path
per owner confirmation: Reaper -> USBStreamer ch 7/8 directly, bypassing
CamillaDSP entirely.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Reaper routing configured: singer IEM outputs (USBStreamer channels 7-8) receive an independent mix routed directly from Reaper, bypassing CamillaDSP
- [ ] IEM mix sources: vocal mic (ch 1), backing tracks from Reaper, vocal cue track from Reaper
- [ ] IEM mix independent of main PA mix (changing PA levels does not affect IEM)
- [ ] IEM mix independent of engineer headphone mix (channels 5-6)
- [ ] Engineer can adjust IEM mix levels via Reaper mixer (and optionally via MIDI controller)
- [ ] Vocal cue track routed to IEM only (not to PA or engineer headphones)
- [ ] Low latency confirmed: IEM path avoids CamillaDSP convolution, total latency ~5ms (Reaper + USB + ADAT)

**DoD:**
- [ ] Reaper routing configuration written (IEM path is Reaper-only, does not involve CamillaDSP)
- [ ] Configuration validated on Pi 4B hardware with actual routing through USBStreamer ch 7/8
- [ ] Audio engineer review passed
- [ ] Lab note documenting the routing and confirming independence of mixes

## US-018: Singer Self-Control of IEM Mix (Nice-to-Have)

**As** the singer,
**I want** to adjust my own in-ear monitor mix levels (more/less voice, more/less
backing track) without needing the engineer,
**so that** I can fine-tune my monitoring comfort during performance.

**Status:** draft (deferred — nice-to-have, not MVP)
**Depends on:** US-017 (base IEM mix must work first)
**Blocks:** none
**Decisions:** none yet

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Singer has a physical control surface or mobile app to adjust IEM levels
- [ ] Adjustable parameters at minimum: own voice level, backing track level, overall IEM volume
- [ ] Changes do not affect PA or engineer mixes
- [ ] Latency of control changes is imperceptible (< 100ms from knob turn to level change)
- [ ] Design reviewed by UX specialist for performer usability (controls must be intuitive during performance)

**DoD:**
- [ ] Solution designed and reviewed by UX specialist and audio engineer
- [ ] Implementation tested on Pi 4B hardware
- [ ] Lab note documenting the control interface and routing

## US-019: Reproducible System Setup — Lab Notes and Migration Path to NixOS

**As** the system builder,
**I want** meticulous lab notes documenting every installation step, package
version, and configuration choice on the current Trixie platform, plus a
deferred plan for NixOS migration,
**so that** I can reproduce the entire setup on a new SD card or new Pi, and
eventually migrate to a fully declarative NixOS configuration.

**Status:** draft (NixOS migration deferred; lab notes active)
**Depends on:** none
**Blocks:** none directly

**Note:** Owner direction: experiment on Trixie now, keep meticulous notes.
NixOS migration is a future goal, blocked by uncertainty about CamillaDSP,
Mixxx, and Reaper packaging for NixOS.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every package installation captured with exact version (`apt list --installed` snapshot or equivalent)
- [ ] Every configuration file change documented with rationale
- [ ] Every manual step documented in lab notes with enough detail for reproduction
- [ ] NixOS feasibility assessment: which components have Nix packages, which would need custom derivations
- [ ] Migration plan outlined as a future story (not implemented now)

**DoD:**
- [ ] Lab notes maintained throughout all other stories
- [ ] NixOS assessment document written (can be brief)
- [ ] Reproducibility verified: could someone rebuild from the lab notes alone? (review by technical writer)

## US-020: Redundancy Plan — Second SD Card, Second Pi, Laptop Fallback

**As** the performer,
**I want** a graded redundancy plan: (1) bootable backup SD card, (2) second Pi
as hot spare, (3) ability to run the stack on a Linux laptop,
**so that** a hardware failure at a gig does not end the show.

**Status:** draft (deferred — future story)
**Depends on:** US-019 (reproducibility is a prerequisite for backup strategies)
**Blocks:** none

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Level 1: SD card cloning procedure documented and tested (boot backup SD, system works)
- [ ] Level 2: second Pi provisioning procedure documented (same config, swap hardware)
- [ ] Level 3: laptop fallback documented (which components run on x86 Linux, what adapters are needed)
- [ ] Recovery time estimated for each level (how long to switch at a gig)

**DoD:**
- [ ] Procedures documented in how-to guides
- [ ] At least Level 1 tested on hardware
- [ ] Audio engineer review passed (is the fallback audio-viable?)

## US-021: Mode Switching — Whole-Gig Configuration Swap

**As** the performer,
**I want** a clean procedure to switch between DJ/PA mode and Live mode before
a gig starts,
**so that** I can configure the system for the type of performance without
error-prone manual config editing.

**Status:** draft
**Depends on:** US-003 (both modes validated), US-006 (Mixxx working), US-017 (live IEM mix working)
**Blocks:** none
**Decisions:** D-002 (dual chunksize)

**Note:** Owner direction: whole-gig switching for now. Mid-event quick switch
is a future nice-to-have and does not need to be seamless.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Single command or script to switch from DJ/PA to Live mode (and vice versa)
- [ ] Switch includes: CamillaDSP config swap (chunksize change), application start/stop (Mixxx vs Reaper), PipeWire routing adjustment if needed
- [ ] Switch is idempotent (running it twice does not break things)
- [ ] Pre-switch validation: checks that required services are running, audio device is connected
- [ ] Post-switch verification: confirms audio routing is correct, DSP is processing
- [ ] Procedure documented as a how-to guide
- [ ] UX specialist review: is the switching workflow clear and error-resistant?

**DoD:**
- [ ] Switch script written and syntax-validated
- [ ] Tested on Pi 4B hardware in both directions
- [ ] How-to guide written
- [ ] UX specialist and audio engineer review passed
